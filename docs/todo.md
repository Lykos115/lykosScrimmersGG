# [1] Static setup

Not going to connect _everything_ just yet but soon^tm

> [-1] Sign up page

> [0] Game pages

Each game page should have the following:

1. Navbar with some (likely)site-wide links - `Home` `OtherGame` `OtherGame2` `etc...`

2. Filter fields - filter by region/game-specific-rank/etc


# [2] Dynamic things

_unironically super low on priority_

User accounts:

> This includes cfg's and what not

Team registration

> Again cfg things 

# Licensing

If any assets require credits, be sure to credit those things.
For now our licensing should be fine(hopefully).

# Links

Pages don't have proper links since everything is temporary/being built

# On-going things

> Imaging

Right now the pages look like treash without proper imaging
