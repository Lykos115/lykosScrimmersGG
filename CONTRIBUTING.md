# Commits

To keep things readable please follow the follow message format

```
+ Additions are on their own line with a plus(+) at the start
- Removals use a minus(-) 
* Modifications should use an  asterisk(*) 
```

As per usual with commits keep them small in size and in nature.
Binary files are exempt from this rule, like fonts, and images/video.

a change of license will happen soon to make the licensing more compatible.
For now assume that we are using the current CCA3.0 license.
